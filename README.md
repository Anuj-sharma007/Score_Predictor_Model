🎓 Student Score Predictor (Machine Learning Project)

This project is a beginner-level Machine Learning application that predicts student exam scores based on study hours. The main goal of this project was to understand the complete ML workflow, including data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment.

📌 Project Overview

This was my first machine learning model created primarily for learning and practice purposes. The model uses Linear Regression to estimate exam scores using study hours as the input feature. Since the model is built using a single feature, its prediction accuracy is limited, but it helped me understand the fundamentals of regression modeling and model deployment.

⚙️ Technologies Used

Python

Pandas & NumPy

Scikit-Learn

Streamlit / Flask 

Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)

📊 Model Details

Model Used: Linear Regression

Input Feature: Study Hours

Target Variable: Exam Score

Evaluation Metrics:

MAE (Mean Absolute Error)

MSE (Mean Squared Error)

R² Score

🚀 Features

Takes study hours as user input

Predicts expected exam score

Simple and interactive web interface

Demonstrates end-to-end ML pipeline

📉 Limitations

Model uses only one feature, so predictions are not highly accurate

Does not consider other important factors like attendance, sleep, motivation, etc.

Built mainly for understanding regression concepts and deployment basics

📚 Learning Outcomes

Through this project, I learned:

Data preprocessing techniques
